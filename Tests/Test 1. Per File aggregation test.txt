This test is used to ensure that parsing and aggregating data volumes are made correctly.

This test processes CDR files from given sample directory. After each file it exports all contents of session maps to DB (table TEST_EXPORT_SESSIONS) then clears session maps and processes next file. 

Script Sample_CDR_creation.sql must be executed created prior to running test!
It creates tables SAMPLE_CDRS, TEST_SESSION_EXPORT, indexes and insert sample data to SAMPLE_CDRS.

Results of session export are being compared to sample CDR data loaded by CDR-PGW Loader. 
Here is the script for creating sample CDR table in Aggregator scheme from Billing scheme where CDR files are uploaded:


After sample CDR data is prepared we can run some compare scripts.

-- Compare data volumes per file
select * from (
select s.filename, sum(s.volume_uplink) / 1000000 sample_uplink, 
	(select sum(t.data_volume_uplink) / 1000000 from TEST_SESSION_EXPORT t where t.filename = s.filename) exported_uplink,
	sum(s.volume_downlink)  / 1000000 sample_downlink, 
	(select sum(t.data_volume_downlink)  / 1000000 from TEST_SESSION_EXPORT t where t.filename = s.filename) exported_downlink
	from SAMPLE_CDRS s group by s.filename)
where sample_uplink <> exported_uplink or sample_downlink <> exported_downlink ; 


-- Compare data volumes per session and find incorrectly exported sessions:
select * from (
select s.charging_id, sum(s.volume_uplink) sample_uplink, (select sum(t.data_volume_uplink) from TEST_SESSION_EXPORT t where t.charging_id = s.charging_id) exported_uplink,
				sum(s.volume_downlink) sample_downlink, (select sum(t.data_volume_downlink) from TEST_SESSION_EXPORT t where t.charging_id = s.charging_id) exported_downlink
	from sample_cdrs s group by s.charging_id)
where sample_uplink <> test_uplink or sample_downlink <> test_downlink ;
